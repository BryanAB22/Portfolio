              <p>(Project for Summer 2023)</p>
              <p>This project is an AI-powered system developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques, deep neural networks, and computer vision algorithms.</p>
              <p>The system is designed to identify individuals from a database of known faces or detect and verify individuals in real-time, with high accuracy and speed.
              </p>
              <p>This technology has a wide range of applications, including security and surveillance, biometric authentication, and user identification in various industries.
              </p>
              <p>The system is able to accurately identify individuals even in challenging lighting conditions and various angles, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about facial recognition.</p>
